      <description>Hello, I am a PhD candidate in Biotechnology at the University of Verona. Officially. But I prefer to consider myself as a newbie in everything. This means that I am very curious and I love to learn and discover new things.
Apart from the romanticisms, I like life sciences and as a PhD candidate in Biotechnology (plant genetics) my project aims at the identification of the genes involved in the regulation of flowering and veraison in grapevine.</description>

      <description>I have to express gratitude to John Muschelli who recorded this useful and very fun video on how to create a website blog using RStudio, blogdown, Github and Netlify. Here is the link https://youtu.be/syWAKaj-4ck. Also I want to thank rbind.io community that provided me with a custom address at the rbind domain, which is very helpful if you want to deploy your blog at Netlify.com and you donâ€™t have your custom address.</description>
