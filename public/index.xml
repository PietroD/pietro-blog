      <description>Hello, I am a PhD candidate in Biotechnology at the University of Verona. Officially. But I prefer to consider myself as a newbie in everything. This means that I am very curious and I love to learn and discover new things.
Apart from the romanticisms, I like life sciences and as a PhD candidate in Biotechnology (plant genetics) my project aims at the identification of the genes involved in the regulation of flowering and veraison in grapevine.</description>

      <description>I have to express gratitude to John Muschelli who recorded this useful and very fun video on how to create a website blog using RStudio, blogdown, Github and Netlify. Here is the link https://youtu.be/syWAKaj-4ck. Also I want to thank rbind.io community that provided me with a custom address at the rbind domain, which is very helpful if you want to deploy your blog at Netlify.com and you don’t have your custom address.</description>

      <description>Principal Component Analysis with various data - tidyverse way In my daily work I am often asked to perform Principal Component Analysis of various type of -omics data, for example data coming from RNA-Seq.
With this data usually the rows correspond to genes (transcripts, proteins, etc..) while columns are individuals or samples.
For example
x ## # A tibble: 846 x 37 ## Row Index `Peak Name` `m/z` `Ret. Time` Group Use `Coltura organo… ## &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; ## 1 NA NA &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; Group 5 ## 2 1 1 sp|P19137|… N/A N/A Lami… TRUE 92493.</description>
