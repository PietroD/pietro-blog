      <description>I work on pancreatic cancer -omics. Data mining on published data is a real source of gold today when someone wants to find confirmation of an hypothesis on a more general scale than his own dataset.
The most common -omics datasets out there are transcriptomics one; both RNA-Seq and good olâ€™ microarray. Regarding RNA-Seq, the well known TCGA and ICGC are my starting point for any explorative data mining analysis.</description>

      <description>I like ggplot2 graphic style, but to make publication acceptable plots, especially to align with graphic style of some journals, sometimes it is necessary to customize plots and modify some parameters that usually are kept as default.
Here I will present some tricks to make beautiful - at least to me - boxplots. I am using the iris dataset, always the best to be reproducible for everyone.
First we define a function to make first letter of each word upper case, retrieved from here https://stackoverflow.</description>

      <description>At work I mostly use R through RStudio server installed on an Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS machine 64-bit.
The current version of R supported by Ubuntu repositories is version 3.4.4, that I installed with sudo apt-get install r-base and on my machine is installed under the /usr/bin/R path.
From what I got reading on the web, RStudio server open starts up automatically recognizing this R installation. Since I wanted to update it to the latest release, at the time of writing version 3.</description>

      <title>Remove legend from ggplot2 plot</title>

      <description>Since I googled this thousands of times, I post it here to help me stick it into my mind.
To completely remove the legend from a ggplot2 graph, use this:
theme(legend.position = &#39;none&#39;)
If in your plot you are using a different theme from the default one, place the above code after the code for the theme, otherwise it will be replaced.
library(tidyverse) iris %&amp;gt;% ggplot(aes(Species, Sepal.Length, col = Species)) + geom_boxplot() # remove legend iris %&amp;gt;% ggplot(aes(Species, Sepal.</description>
