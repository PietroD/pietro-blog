      <description>I have to express gratitude to John Muschelli who recorded this useful and very fun video on how to create a website blog using RStudio, blogdown, Github and Netlify. Here is the link https://youtu.be/syWAKaj-4ck. Also I want to thank rbind.io community that provided me with a custom address at the rbind domain, which is very helpful if you want to deploy your blog at Netlify.com and you donâ€™t have your custom address.</description>
