<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am a PhD candidate in Biotechnology at the University of Verona, Italy. Officially. But I prefer to consider myself as a newbie in everything. This means that I am very curious and I love to learn and discover new things.</p>
<p>Apart from the romanticisms, I like life sciences and as a PhD candidate in Biotechnology (plant genetics) my project aims at <a href="/./about_files/Delfino_Poster_SIGA_2017.pdf"><strong>the identification of the genes involved in the regulation of flowering and veraison in grapevine</strong></a>. Veraison is that stage of berry development where the berries start to become soft and change color (from green to white/red).</p>
<p>The approaches I am following are mainly <em>in silico</em>; that means that I work most of the time at my laptop with genomic sequences, genetic polymorphisms and phenotypic data. For the specialists, this is a genetic association study (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study"><strong>Genome-Wide Association Study</strong></a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_gene"><strong>Candidate-Gene Association Study</strong></a>). Some they consider me bioinformatician, I prefer the term computational biologist, since I trained as a biotechnologist and I had not informatic competences more or less two years before now.</p>
<p>Recently I fall in love with data and ways to manipulate them. Since then I became interested in that wonderful world related to <a href="https://www.r-project.org/"><strong>R</strong></a>, which is my daily working “language”.</p>
