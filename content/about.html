<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Diagnostic and Public Health at the University of Verona. I work as a computational biologist (some they say bioinformatician) on pancreatic cancer genomics and transcriptomics data mainly, but I also perform statistical analysis and public datasets mining, meta-analysis and much more.</p>
<p>I did my PhD in Biotechnology at the same university. I am very curious and I love to learn and discover new things.</p>
<p>I like life sciences and as a PhD candidate in Biotechnology (plant genetics) my project aimed at <a href="/./about_files/Delfino_Poster_SIGA_2017.pdf"><strong>the identification of the genes involved in the regulation of flowering and veraison in grapevine</strong></a>. Veraison is that stage of berry development where the berries start to become soft and change color (from green to white/red).</p>
<p>The approaches I followed were <em>in silico</em>; that means that I worked most of the time at my laptop with genomic sequences, genetic polymorphisms and phenotypic data. For the specialists, this is a genetic association study (i.e. Genome-Wide Association Study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study"><strong>GWAS</strong></a>, or Candidate-Gene Association Study). Some they consider me <em>Bioinformatician</em>, I prefer the term <em>Computational biologist</em>, since I trained as a biotechnologist and I had not informatic competences more or less three years before now.</p>
<p>Recently I fall in love with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"><strong>data</strong></a> and ways to manipulate them. Since then I became interested in that wonderful world related to <a href="https://www.r-project.org/"><strong>R</strong></a>, which is my daily working “language”.</p>
