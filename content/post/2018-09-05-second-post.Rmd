I have to express gratitude to John Muschelli who recorded this useful and very fun video on how to create a website blog using RStudio, blogdown, Github and Netlify. Here is the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syWAKaj-4ck.
Also I want to thank rbind.io community that provided me with a custom address at the rbind domain, which is very helpful if you want to deploy your blog at Netlify.com and you don't have your custom address.
So my recommendation is to watch the video and google some help to get this very wonderful way of publishing content directly from RStudio
