# Principal Component Analysis with various data - tidyverse way

In my daily work I am often asked to perform Principal Component Analysis of various type of *-omics* data, for example data coming from RNA-Seq.

With this data usually the rows correspond to genes (transcripts, proteins, etc..) while columns are individuals or samples.

For example

```{r, include=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
x <- read_xlsx('QQ colture dati aggiuntivi 28082018.xlsx')
```

```{r, include=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
x
```
